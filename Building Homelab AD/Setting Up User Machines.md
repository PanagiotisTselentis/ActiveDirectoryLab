I am gonna deploy 2 user machines and I used a **Windows 10 Enterprise** ISO file in order to build these two machines.

So I created two Windows 10 Enterprise VMs one called `THEPUNISHER` and the other called `SPIDERMAN`.

After the initial setup, I went to rename this PC:

And I named it `THEPUNISHER`:

and then I rebooted the machine:

I did the same thing with the `SPIDERMAN` VM.
